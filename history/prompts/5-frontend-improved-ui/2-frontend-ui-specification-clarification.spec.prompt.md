## Clarification Session Complete

I've successfully completed the clarification workflow for the frontend UI improvements specification. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

**Questions Asked & Answered: 5**
1. Defined specific performance metrics (page load time < 2s, 60fps responsiveness)
2. Specified WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria (1.4.3, 2.4.7, 4.1.2)
3. Addressed color blindness accessibility with additional visual indicators
4. Implemented conflict resolution strategy for concurrent task modifications
5. Specified REST API integration approach with error handling

**Path to Updated Spec:**
- `C:\Users\Wajiz.pk\Desktop\todo app hackathon 2\specs\5-frontend-improved-ui\spec.md`

**Sections Touched:**
- Added "Clarifications" section with session details
- Updated "Functional Requirements" with 5 new requirements (FR-014 to FR-019)
- Enhanced accessibility and performance specifications

**Coverage Summary:**
- Functional Scope & Behavior: Resolved (was Partial)
- Domain & Data Model: Deferred (was Missing)
- Interaction & UX Flow: Resolved (was Partial)
- Non-Functional Quality Attributes: Resolved (was Partial)
- Security & Privacy: Deferred (was Missing)
- Integration & External Dependencies: Resolved (was Missing)
- Edge Cases & Failure Handling: Resolved (was Partial)
- Constraints & Tradeoffs: Clear
- Terminology & Consistency: Clear
- Completion Signals: Deferred (was Partial)
- Misc/Placeholders: Clear

**Outstanding Items:**
- Domain & Data Model: Could benefit from more detailed data structure definitions
- Security & Privacy: Additional security requirements could be defined
- Completion Signals: More detailed acceptance criteria could be added

**Suggested Next Command:**
I recommend proceeding with `/sp.plan` to create an architecture plan based on the clarified requirements.

## Outcome

Successfully clarified 5 key areas in the frontend UI improvements specification, adding specific performance metrics, accessibility requirements, conflict resolution strategy, and API integration approach. The specification now includes 5 additional functional requirements (FR-014 to FR-019) addressing performance, accessibility, concurrency handling, and API integration.

## Evaluation

The clarification session successfully addressed the highest priority ambiguities in the specification, particularly around performance, accessibility, and integration aspects. The specification is now more concrete and actionable for the planning phase.
