## Implementation Progress Summary

I analyzed the existing frontend codebase and updated the tasks.md file to reflect the current implementation status. Based on my analysis of the existing components:

1. **Phase 1 Setup Tasks**: All completed (T001-T005)
2. **Phase 2 Foundational Tasks**: Almost all completed (T010-T014), with T015 remaining
3. **Phase 3 Authentication Forms**: All major features completed (T020-T033), with only testing task remaining (T034)
4. **Phase 4 Dashboard UI**: Most features completed (T040-T046, T049), with API integration tasks remaining (T047-T048) and testing (T050)
5. **Phase 5 Task Management**: Most features completed (T055-T062, T065), with optimistic locking tasks remaining (T063-T064) and testing (T066)
6. **Phase 6 Homepage/Navigation**: Most features completed (T070-T074), with testing tasks remaining (T075-T076)
7. **Phase 7 Accessibility**: Loading and toast features completed (T083-T088), with WCAG compliance tasks remaining (T080-T082) and testing (T089-T090)
8. **Phase 8 Polish**: Error boundaries completed (T097), with performance and other tasks remaining (T095-T096, T098-T100)

## Key Findings

The frontend already has extensive UI improvements implemented:
- Authentication forms with password visibility toggle and real-time validation
- Dashboard with statistics cards (using mock data)
- Task management with priority color coding and visual feedback
- Responsive navigation with consistent header design
- Loading states and toast notifications
- Form validation with character counts

## Remaining Critical Tasks

1. T063-T064: Implement optimistic locking for concurrent task modifications
2. T047-T048: Complete dashboard API integration with real data
3. T080-T082: Complete WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification
4. Performance optimization tasks (T095-T096)

## Outcome

Updated tasks.md to accurately reflect implementation status. Many tasks were already completed in the existing codebase, with 32+ tasks marked as completed and approximately 17 tasks remaining to be completed.

## Evaluation

The implementation analysis revealed that the frontend UI improvements are largely already implemented. The task file now accurately reflects the current status, enabling proper tracking of remaining work.
