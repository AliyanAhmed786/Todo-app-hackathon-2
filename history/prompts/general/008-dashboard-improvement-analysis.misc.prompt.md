## Response Text

## Specification Analysis Report

Identified inconsistencies, duplications, ambiguities, and underspecified items across spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md for the dashboard improvement feature.

## Outcome

Completed comprehensive analysis of the dashboard improvement specification, identifying 10 key issues across coverage gaps, inconsistencies, underspecification, duplication, and constitution alignment. The analysis revealed that the optimistic locking requirement has no corresponding task, authentication implementation lacks specific Better Auth tasks, and the 5-minute preemptive token refresh requirement is not explicitly reflected in tasks. Coverage percentage is approximately 80% with some critical gaps that should be addressed before implementation.

## Evaluation

The analysis successfully identified critical issues in the specification and task breakdown that should be addressed before proceeding with implementation. The most critical issues include missing optimistic locking implementation, Better Auth integration gaps, and unclear token refresh timing requirements.
